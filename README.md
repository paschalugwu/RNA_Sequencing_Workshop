# RNA_Sequencing_Workshop
Topic: RNA-Seq differential gene expression (DGE) analysis using datasets from common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) makes use of high-throughput sequencing techniques to shed light on a cell's transcriptome. It is a commonly used technique for examining the activity of genes under various biological circumstances and a potential new technology for precisely monitoring gene expression levels. The goal of this project was to use RNA-Seq to measure the amount of mRNA in several samples of the Drosophila melanogaster and statistically evaluate the variations in expression per-gene between the samples using differential gene expression analyses. I carried out the following tasks: QC (Quality Control) of the raw sequence data, trimming of the RNA reads for amount and adapter sequence, QC for the RNA-Seq alignment data, alignment of quality RNA reads, visualization of the RNA-Seq alignment data with IGV and JBrowse, and discovery of differentially expressed genes in the samples. Trim Galore, HISAT, HTSEQ, Deseq2, and FeatureCounts were the tools I utilized. By testing for differential expression analysis for samples of Drosophila melanogaster, this study has given me the opportunity to comprehend the fundamental workflow of alignment quantification.
